All pages are responsive and styled.

1. Home Page featured welcoming statements.
2. Browse Page featured the menu with descriptions.
3. Login Page allows user to create an account and login. It requires each input to fill out the infos in order for successful login. It also alert the user that the account login in is succesful.
   However, I struggled with the appending the user input to the database....

4. Once you sign up to create the recipe, you should be able to view the Create Recipe Page. It shows you the required input for creating your new recipes.

<!-- //Didn't work  -->

5. Your new recipe data should be update in Your Recipe page. It has edit, delete, and view button.
   You should be able to logout to return home.

I've tried my best with CRUD... :(
